## How to Use This Catalog

### Finding Skills
- Browse by **category** for domain-specific skills
- Browse by **type** for structural patterns
- Browse by **optimization** for outcome-focused skills
- Use browser search (Ctrl/Cmd+F) to find keywords

### Invoking Skills
```bash
/skill-name [arguments]
```

### Creating Skills
Use the `/skill-writer` meta-skill to automatically generate optimized skills:
```bash
/skill-writer "Create a skill for [your workflow]"
```

### Understanding Modes & Optimization

Skills use a **3-mode system** that automatically optimizes based on cost of failure:

#### The Three Modes
- **Industrial Mode** (High Strictness): If AI fails, something breaks → Reliability 90%
- **Muse Mode** (High Creativity): If AI fails, just try again → Style 90%
- **Socratic Mode** (Educational): If AI fails, user learns → Learning 90%

Modes are **presets** for the 4 optimization dimensions:
- **Reliability**: Error-proofing, 100% consistency
- **Precision**: Ambiguity reduction
- **Learning**: User growth, understanding
- **Style**: Voice and nuance

See [MODES-GUIDE.md](MODES-GUIDE.md) for mode selection and [OPTIMIZATION-AND-TOOLS.md](OPTIMIZATION-AND-TOOLS.md) for dimension details.

### Tool Integration
Skills can leverage tools for:
- **Calculator**: Deterministic math/logic
- **Library**: External/real-time data
- **Keyboard**: State-changing actions
- **Sandbox**: Output verification

See [TOOLS-GUIDE.md](TOOLS-GUIDE.md) for patterns.

### Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding new skills.
